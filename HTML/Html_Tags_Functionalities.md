## HTML Tag Functionalities

When you're learning HTML, it's helpful to understand how the various tags are categorized and used. Generally, HTML tags serve one of three purposes: **container tags**, **typography tags**, and **miscellaneous tags**. Let's break this down in a way that's easy to grasp.

### 1. **Container Tags** üß≥

Container tags are like the "organizers" of your HTML content. They're used to group or contain other elements. You can think of them as "containers" in real life, like drawers in a dresser. For example, you might have one drawer for socks, and within that drawer, you have smaller compartments for different types of socks (long socks, short socks, etc.). Similarly, in HTML, we use container tags to organize related content or group items for styling or layout purposes.

#### Types of Container Tags:

- **Semantic Container Tags** (meaningful tags):
  - `<head></head>`: Contains metadata about the HTML page (like title, character encoding, etc.). **Single-use**.
  - `<body></body>`: This is the main content of your page‚Äîeverything visible to the user goes here. **Single-use**.
  - `<header></header>`: Contains the header of your page (logo, navigation, etc.). **Single-use**.
  - `<nav></nav>`: This is for navigation links (e.g., menu items). **Single-use**.
  - `<main></main>`: The main content of your page that‚Äôs not in the header or footer. **Single-use**.
  - `<footer></footer>`: Contains footer info (e.g., contact details, copyright). **Single-use**.
  - `<aside></aside>`: Contains content that‚Äôs separate from the main content (e.g., sidebars or related links).
  - `<form><input></form>`: Used for user interaction, collecting data (e.g., login forms, registration forms).
  - `<section></section>`: Groups related content into a section (e.g., a section about a product, a blog post, etc.).
  - `<ul><li></ul>`: Defines an unordered list of items.
  
- **Non-semantic Container Tags** (for general purposes, not meaningful by themselves):
  - `<div></div>`: The most common container tag. It‚Äôs used to wrap any content without giving it specific meaning. Think of it like a basic box.
  - `<span></span>`: An inline container used for applying styles to a part of a text or element.

#### Example of Container Tags in Action:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <nav>
      <a href="#home">Home</a>
      <a href="#about">About</a>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a tech company dedicated to innovation.</p>
    </section>

    <aside>
      <p>Quick Links:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p>¬© 2025 My Company</p>
  </footer>
</body>
```

Here, the `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` are all **semantic container tags** organizing specific content on the page.

### 2. **Typography Tags** ‚úçÔ∏è

Typography tags help you control the **appearance of text** on your page. It's similar to how you use font size or style in a word processor. These tags help you define headings, paragraphs, and other text-based content.

#### Types of Typography Tags:

- **Headings**: HTML provides six levels of headings:
  - `<h1>`: Largest heading, typically for the main title of the page.
  - `<h2>`: A smaller heading, used for sections or subsections.
  - `<h3>` through `<h6>`: These get progressively smaller, used for deeper levels of headings or subheadings.
  
- **Paragraph**:
  - `<p></p>`: Defines a paragraph of text. Used for general content that's not a heading.

#### Example of Typography Tags:

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We are a tech company that focuses on innovation and solving problems. Our mission is to make life easier with cutting-edge technology.</p>
```

### 3. **Miscellaneous Tags** üß©

Miscellaneous tags serve various purposes and allow you to do things like take user input, add images, or create links. There are many of these tags, but here are some of the most important ones:

- `<input />`: Used for various input types like text, dates, and files (it‚Äôs self-closing).
- `<textarea></textarea>`: Used for larger, multi-line text inputs (e.g., comments or feedback).
- `<img />`: Displays images on the webpage (self-closing tag).
- `<mark></mark>`: Highlights or emphasizes text.
- `<details></details>`: Creates collapsible content (expandable text).
- `<button></button>`: Defines a clickable button (usually for submitting forms or triggering actions).
- `<a></a>`: Creates hyperlinks (links to other pages or websites).

#### Example of Miscellaneous Tags:

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
  
  <label for="comment">Comment:</label>
  <textarea id="comment" name="comment"></textarea>
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit our website</a>
```

### Recap & Practice
- **Container Tags**: Use them to group related content together, just like putting things into drawers or boxes.
- **Typography Tags**: They define how your text looks on the page (headings, paragraphs, etc.).
- **Miscellaneous Tags**: These handle things like images, forms, links, and other dynamic elements.
