## Overview

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages. It provides structure to the content by using elements such as:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type.
- `<html>`: Root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`, `<title>`, `<meta>`: Metadata and page settings.
- `<body>`: Main content of the webpage.
- Semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, etc.

Some concepts I've explored:
- Block vs inline elements
- Form creation and input types
- Accessibility using proper semantics
- Embedding images, videos, and iframes
- Tables and lists

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the appearance of HTML elements. It defines **how** elements look on a page, including colors, layout, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

Topics covered:
- Inline, internal, and external stylesheets
- Selectors: element, class, id, attribute, pseudo-classes
- Box model: `margin`, `border`, `padding`, `content`
- Flexbox and Grid systems for layout
- Responsive design with media queries
- CSS variables and custom properties

### JavaScript

JavaScript is the programming language that makes web pages interactive. It allows dynamic content updates, user interaction handling, and asynchronous operations.

Key concepts covered:
- Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`), data types, and operators
- Functions (declarations, expressions, arrow functions)
- DOM manipulation (selecting elements, event listeners)
- Control flow (conditionals, loops)
- Objects, arrays, and common methods
- ES6+ features (template literals, destructuring, spread/rest)
- Asynchronous JS (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Error handling with try/catch
