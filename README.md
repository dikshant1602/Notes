##  Overview

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages. It provides structure to the content by using elements such as:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type.
- `<html>`: Root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`, `<title>`, `<meta>`: Metadata and page settings.
- `<body>`: Main content of the webpage.
- Semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, etc.

Some concepts I've explored:
- Block vs inline elements
- Form creation and input types
- Accessibility using proper semantics
- Embedding images, videos, and iframes
- Tables and lists

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the appearance of HTML elements. It defines **how** elements look on a page, including colors, layout, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

Topics covered:
- Inline, internal, and external stylesheets
- Selectors: element, class, id, attribute, pseudo-classes
- Box model: `margin`, `border`, `padding`, `content`
- Flexbox and Grid systems for layout
- Responsive design with media queries
- CSS variables and custom properties
